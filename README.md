Agent-Based Modelling is a modelling technique simulating every aspect of an environment as an Agent with particular properties and behaviours. These agents are simulated in space and time but require a large amount of resources to compute. The time complexity of these simulations can be equally high taking hours to days to compute depending on application and detail included in the simulation.

Emulating simulations with AI models is a new avenue of research develing into the possiiblity of simplifying the resources and time needed to simulate these programs after an initial set up cost of training the models. Training these models with the physics from ABM's allows them to learn the average behaviour of these systems which enables them to predict and emulate responses of the progrem without significant time cost.
